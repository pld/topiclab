<p>The Ureport data was divided into 5 topics (number not selected for any speical reason) based on the LDA algorithm, which uses word co-occurence.</p>
<p>Note the bars are not normalized by response occurence, and they should be.</p>
<p>The bar charts show, from topic 1 on the left to topic 5 on the right, the number of times a response from that district was assigned to this topic.</p>
<p>The tag clouds, below, show the first 10 unique words by frequency for each topic scaled based on number of occurences in the topic.</p>
<p>Note that LDA is a stochastic algorithm, another run will produce different topics, different unique words, and different frequencies for those unique words.</p>
